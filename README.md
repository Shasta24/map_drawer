# 2D random Map in Python 
Python 2D random map in nested list used with easygraphics lib
For learning pruposes.

First use the generator file to crate a map which will be stored in the map.txt file.
Than you can use the map_drawr to look at it. 

You can change the X and Y sizes of the map, as well as bye changing the value of varibale K the sizes of the islands.
(You can find some images with different K values at https://github.com/Shasta24/map_drawer/wiki ) 
Keep in mind that you should use the same value for the varibale max_height in both of the files. 


After this step you are freely able to implement new functions. Such as:
 - make an outline on a clicked island
 - draw the shortest bridges between two choosen islands
 - dig areas or cover them up.
